# ModelWeights.jl

A package to compute weights (based on independence- and performance) for ensembles of Earth System Models (ESMs), especially CMIP models, including convenience functions for handling climate model data.

To use the provided functionalities the data must be available on the same grid.


## Package features

- load data for different variables/experiments into convenient data format
- filter data to get only models with specific variables for various experiments
- compute independence weights based on model similarity
- compute performance weights based on historical period or based on custom function
- combine independence- and performance weights
