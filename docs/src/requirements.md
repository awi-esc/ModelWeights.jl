# Requirements
We assume that you have your preprocessed data ready, so that the data from the different models can be combined, meaning that all models must for instance be defined on the same grid. We do the preprocessing of the data with ESMValTool. 
 <!-- A set of recipes to download and preprocess some data can be found in our repository [ESMDataPrep](https://github.com/awi-esc/ESMDataPrep). -->
